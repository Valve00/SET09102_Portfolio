Use meaningful names
Using meaningful names leads to clean code as for example it refers than instead of naming a variable (TNum) It could be named (NumberOfAttemps) which is more meaningful and makes the name describe itself therefore when someone else looks at the code they know what the variable is for and doesn't need explanation, therefore that part of the code is self documenting.

Functions
Functions should be consise, they should only cover only one function and not spread all over the place integrating other stuff that could be part of a different function. They should be as hermetic/independent as possible as to avoid over complicating the code and possible errors. As well as their name should describe the action they carry out.

Comments
People should be able to read clean code as it should be self explanatory, even though is some circumstances that might be complicated and a comment might need to be added. A programer can always choose to try and rewrite their code to make it easier to understand and therefore not have to include a comment to explain themselves.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
This clean code rule is extremely simple to follow, as it's name, programers should avoid overcomplicating their code, keeping everything as basic as possible instead of building code over code over code and ending up with a complete mess and extremely complicated and hard to understand code.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
If a programer is faced with having to use a very similar function but with small changes they will be tempted to copy paste the function and make the alterations, instead they should rewrite the original function as to be able to work in both instances, this way it keeps the programer from having repeated code, and therefore it keeps the code easier to read, making it comply with the clean code ideal.

YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
This rule refers to keeping code simple by avoiding adding extra functions, as programers will try and anticipate what they need, although they might never actually need it, that leads to unused code that makes code 'dirty' and therefore every programer should avoid adding unnecessary code.
