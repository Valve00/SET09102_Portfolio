For this task I was unable to write any code, as we were required to write 2 tests in a team of 17 people, which lead to two people writing the tests and the rest of the team to sit and be unable to complete any more work as that was all the available tasks to complete.
The code that we were tasked to test was meant to be used on a hangman game, the game was in an unfinished state, therefore it couldn't be played even after completing the given tasks, but each individual method was still functional and testable.
Our tests were limited as we were unable to obtain an equal share of responsability and as two people completed all of them the rest of the team was left hanging without knowing how the tests worked. As well as because they were done by a couple of people there was a lack of input from the rest of the team, which ended up producing errors, and some people which had great ideas were unable to implement them in the team work.
