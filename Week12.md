In this last week there wasn't much work done as most tasks had been finished, as well as personally I couldn't find anything to work on. This caused myself to lack many things to talk about during this week's portfolio entry.
Reflecting back to my work there could be improvements like finding more work to do, and if i was more skilled with coding it would make it easier to achieve more progress and write more down for the portfolio. If I was to re-do the portfolio and the project I would try to do more coding and improve team communication which were the main problems with completing the project as well as improving personal work aims.
