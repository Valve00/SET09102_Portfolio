Compared to other people in our team that have done a lot more programming I focused more on the team work aspect and other parts. These past weeks I have realised the importance of weighting tasks correctly as some might take a very long time and should be divided into smaller chunks to make it easier to achieve.
This can be observed as some tasks from week3 haven't been completed until this point in time. One of the most common issues is the lack of communication between team members made some work more complicated but it was an issue that was fixed within the team with no issues.
When given code to review the major comment that I made was that there was a lack of comments where they are necessary and code not being self explanatory.
