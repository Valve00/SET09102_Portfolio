This week I didn't work on any parts of the team project's code. I wasn't asked to review any code therefore I don't have anything to mention.
The most common problem that I identified from my team this week was an issue with distributing the workload as some people might take multiple tasks from the task list, while other people would take one item or none at all.
Althought I didn't directly assist in the coding for this week I provided support when asked about the tasks that had to be carried out as some descriptions weren't descriptive enough.
