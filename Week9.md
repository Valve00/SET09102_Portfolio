This week I helped other teammate with code review, although I needed the help from others to be able to fix some complex issues, although I helped with sticking to good coding practices, like not repeating code and only adding necessary code.
Other than that I didn't do any code myself as I used my skills helping others instead of programing which is my weak point.
